# The Art of New York Artisan Cheese: From Traditional Techniques to Modern Innovation

*Published by New York Dairy Co. | 10 min read*

In the heart of New York State's dairy country, something magical is happening in farmhouse kitchens and modern creameries alike. The ancient art of cheese making—once nearly lost to industrial production—is experiencing a remarkable renaissance. From the Finger Lakes to the Hudson Valley, from the North Country to the Southern Tier, New York artisan cheese makers are creating world-class cheeses that rival those from the most famous European regions.

As a dairy farm that has embraced artisan cheese making as part of our operation, we're excited to share the story of this incredible movement and what makes New York such a special place for artisan cheese production.

## The Rich Heritage of New York Cheese Making

New York's cheese making tradition runs deep. Dutch settlers brought their cheese making knowledge to the Hudson Valley in the 1600s, while later waves of German, Swiss, and Italian immigrants contributed their own techniques and traditions. By the 1800s, New York was America's leading cheese producer, with regions like Herkimer County becoming famous for their distinctive cheddar.

The industrialization of dairy production in the mid-20th century nearly wiped out this artisan tradition. Large factories could produce cheese more cheaply and consistently, and small farmstead operations couldn't compete. But in the 1980s and 90s, a new generation of cheese makers began reviving these traditional methods, combining old-world techniques with modern food safety practices and innovative aging methods.

Today, New York is home to over 60 licensed artisan cheese makers, from tiny farmstead operations producing a few hundred pounds per year to larger creameries distributing nationally ([American Cheese Society, 2023](https://cheesesociety.org)). This diversity of scale and style makes New York one of America's most dynamic cheese making regions.

## Understanding Artisan Cheese: More Than Just Handmade

The term "artisan cheese" gets thrown around frequently, but what does it really mean? True artisan cheese is characterized by several key elements:

**Small-Scale Production**: Artisan cheese makers typically produce limited quantities, allowing for careful attention to detail at every step of the process.

**Traditional Techniques**: While food safety methods are modern, the actual cheese making processes often date back centuries, passed down through generations or learned through apprenticeships with master cheese makers.

**High-Quality Milk**: Artisan cheese starts with exceptional milk, often from a single herd or even a specific group of animals whose milk has unique characteristics.

**Hands-On Craftsmanship**: Skilled cheese makers use their senses—sight, smell, touch, and taste—to guide the process, making adjustments based on subtle variations in milk, weather, and seasonal changes.

**Unique Terroir**: Like wine, artisan cheeses reflect their environment. The local climate, the plants the cows eat, the native bacteria in the air, and even the caves or aging rooms where cheeses mature all contribute to distinctive flavors that can't be replicated elsewhere.

## The Science and Art of Cheese Making

Cheese making is fundamentally a controlled spoilage process that transforms liquid milk into a shelf-stable, flavorful food. While the basic process is simple—add cultures and rennet to milk, drain the whey, and age the curds—the variations and nuances are infinite.

**The Role of Milk Quality**: Everything starts with exceptional milk. Our Jersey cows produce milk with particularly high fat and protein content, perfect for cheese making. The seasonal variations in their diet—fresh spring grass, diverse summer pastures, autumn hay—create subtle differences in milk composition that experienced cheese makers can work with to create unique seasonal cheeses.

**Cultures and Bacteria**: The magic of cheese happens through carefully controlled bacterial fermentation. Different bacterial strains produce different flavors, textures, and aging characteristics. Some cultures we use have been maintained in continuous production for over 100 years, carrying the genetic memory of countless generations of cheese making.

**Rennet and Coagulation**: Rennet causes milk proteins to form curds. Traditional animal rennet creates different textures than vegetable rennet, and the timing and temperature of addition affects everything from moisture content to aging potential.

**Moisture and Salt**: The amount of whey drained from curds and the salt content determine how a cheese will age. High-moisture cheeses like fresh mozzarella are eaten immediately, while low-moisture cheeses can age for years, developing complex flavors over time.

## Signature New York Cheese Styles

New York's diverse geography and climate have given rise to several distinctive cheese styles that capture the character of different regions:

**Hudson Valley Bloomy Rinds**: The Hudson Valley's moderate climate and high humidity are perfect for soft-ripened cheeses with white, bloomy rinds. These cheeses, similar to French Camembert or Brie, ripen from the outside in, developing creamy textures and mushroomy, earthy flavors.

**Adirondack Hard Cheeses**: The cooler climate of the Adirondacks is ideal for aging hard cheeses. Many producers create clothbound cheddars and alpine-style cheeses that develop complex, nutty flavors during extended aging periods.

**Finger Lakes Blues**: The natural caves and consistent temperatures of the Finger Lakes region provide perfect conditions for blue cheese production. The native Penicillium roqueforti in the air contributes to unique flavor profiles that distinguish New York blues from those made elsewhere.

**Long Island Fresh Cheeses**: The maritime climate of Long Island is perfect for fresh cheeses like mozzarella, ricotta, and fromage blanc. These cheeses showcase the pure, clean flavors of high-quality milk without the complexity that comes from aging.

## Our Farmstead Cheese Making Journey

Three years ago, we decided to add artisan cheese making to our dairy operation. It started as a way to add value to our milk and provide our customers with products that truly captured the essence of our farm. What began as weekend experiments in our kitchen has grown into a licensed creamery producing six different cheese varieties.

**Learning the Craft**: We started by attending workshops at the Vermont Institute for Artisan Cheese and studying with established cheese makers throughout New York. The learning curve was steep—cheese making requires both technical precision and intuitive understanding that only comes with experience.

**Building Our Creamery**: We converted a 1,200-square-foot barn into a state-licensed cheese making facility. The investment was significant—stainless steel vats, proper drainage, temperature and humidity controls, and aging rooms—but the New York State Department of Agriculture provided technical assistance and some funding through their agricultural development programs.

**Developing Our Signature Cheeses**: We spent months perfecting our recipes. Our flagship cheese is a semi-hard farmstead cheese we call "Meadowsweet," made exclusively from the milk of our Jersey cows. We also produce a fresh chèvre-style cheese using goat milk from a neighboring farm, seasonal flavored varieties, and a natural-rind cheese that we age in our converted root cellar.

**The Seasonal Rhythm**: One of the most rewarding aspects of farmstead cheese making is how it connects us to the seasonal rhythms of farming. Spring cheeses have a light, grassy character. Summer cheeses are rich and complex from diverse pasture plants. Fall cheeses develop deeper, nuttier flavors. Winter cheeses, made from hay-fed milk, have a completely different character.

## The Economics of Artisan Cheese Production

Artisan cheese making isn't just about preserving tradition—it's also a viable business model that can help small dairy farms remain profitable in an increasingly competitive market.

**Value Addition**: While we might receive $18-20 per hundredweight for fluid milk, that same milk can generate $200-300 per hundredweight when transformed into artisan cheese. This dramatic value increase allows smaller operations to compete with industrial producers.

**Direct Marketing**: Artisan cheese connects us directly with consumers. We sell at three farmers' markets, through a local CSA program, and directly from our farm store. These direct relationships allow us to capture the full retail value of our products while building customer loyalty.

**Wholesale Opportunities**: New York's restaurant scene increasingly values local, artisan products. We now supply cheese to six restaurants within 50 miles of our farm, and demand continues to grow. The farm-to-table movement has created opportunities for small producers that didn't exist a generation ago.

**Agritourism Synergies**: Our cheese making operation has become a draw for farm visitors. We offer cheese making workshops, tasting events, and guided tours. This agritourism income helps support the entire farm operation while educating consumers about artisan food production.

## Food Safety and Regulation: Modern Standards, Traditional Methods

One of the biggest challenges in artisan cheese making is meeting strict food safety requirements while preserving traditional methods. New York State has some of the most comprehensive dairy regulations in the country, but they're designed to ensure safety while allowing for artisan production methods.

**HACCP Plans**: Every licensed cheese maker must develop and follow a Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points plan. This systematic approach to food safety identifies potential risks and establishes procedures to prevent contamination.

**Facility Requirements**: Our creamery meets all state requirements for food-grade surfaces, proper drainage, hand-washing facilities, and temperature controls. While these requirements represent significant investment, they also give us confidence that our products are safe for consumers.

**Testing Protocols**: We test our products regularly for pathogens and maintain detailed records of every batch. This testing regime protects consumers while also providing valuable feedback about our processes.

**Raw Milk Regulations**: New York allows the production of raw milk cheeses aged more than 60 days. This traditional practice, when done properly, can create unique flavors impossible to achieve with pasteurized milk. However, it requires even more stringent safety protocols and regular testing.

## The Role of Terroir in New York Cheeses

French cheese makers have long understood the concept of terroir—the idea that local environmental factors give agricultural products distinctive characteristics. New York artisan cheese makers are discovering that our state has incredibly diverse terroir that influences cheese flavors in subtle but important ways.

**Milk Composition**: The plants our cows eat directly affect milk composition. Cows grazing on diverse pastures with wildflowers, herbs, and different grass species produce milk with more complex flavor compounds than those fed standardized diets.

**Seasonal Variations**: New York's distinct seasons create natural variations in milk composition. Spring flush milk is high in moisture and has a fresh, green flavor. Summer milk is rich in fat and has complex flavors from diverse forages. Fall milk begins to concentrate as production naturally decreases. Winter milk from hay-fed animals has completely different characteristics.

**Native Microbes**: The bacteria and mold in our environment contribute to cheese flavors. Our aging rooms develop their own microbial populations over time, creating house flavors that distinguish our cheeses from those made elsewhere. Some cheese makers deliberately introduce local microbes by aging cheeses in regional caves or cellars.

**Water Sources**: The mineral content of our water supply affects cheese making in subtle ways. Our farm's well water is naturally filtered through limestone, contributing mineral notes to our finished cheeses.

## Pairing New York Artisan Cheeses

Part of the artisan cheese experience is learning how different cheeses pair with other foods, beverages, and seasonal occasions. New York's diverse cheese styles offer pairing opportunities for every palate and occasion.

**Wine Pairings**: New York's growing wine industry creates natural pairing opportunities. Finger Lakes Rieslings complement our fresh goat cheeses beautifully. Hudson Valley Cabernet Francs pair excellently with aged cheddar-style cheeses. Sparkling wines from Long Island enhance the creamy textures of bloomy rind cheeses.

**Local Product Pairings**: We love showcasing other New York artisan products alongside our cheeses. Wildflower honey from local apiaries, preserves made from regional fruit, and crackers from New York grain mills create cheese boards that tell the story of our region's agricultural diversity.

**Seasonal Pairings**: Different cheeses shine in different seasons. Fresh cheeses are perfect for summer entertaining, while aged cheeses provide comfort during winter months. We work with local chefs to develop seasonal menus that highlight these natural progressions.

## Supporting New York's Artisan Cheese Community

The growth of New York's artisan cheese industry has created a supportive community of producers, distributors, and enthusiasts who work together to promote locally made products.

**The American Cheese Society**: Many New York cheese makers belong to this national organization, which provides education, networking, and advocacy for artisan producers. The annual conference brings together cheese makers from around the world to share techniques and innovations.

**Regional Associations**: The New York State Cheesemakers Guild brings together producers from across the state for workshops, marketing initiatives, and advocacy efforts. This collaborative approach helps all producers succeed.

**Distribution Networks**: Specialized distributors like Murray's Cheese and regional food hubs help connect small producers with retail and restaurant customers throughout the Northeast. These partnerships are essential for reaching markets beyond immediate local areas.

**Educational Institutions**: Cornell University's dairy science program and the New York State College of Agriculture and Life Sciences provide research support and technical assistance to cheese makers. This academic connection helps producers stay current with food safety developments and production innovations.
